Hello everyone, and welcome to this short series on creating a pathfinding system for grid-based games in Unity.

In this series, we will build a comprehensive pathfinding system that you can use in any grid-based game. 
It will also feature dynamic map control, meaning that any changes in the grid will be detected by the moving entities, 
ensuring no collisions.

In this first video, weâ€™ll set up our scene and grid system before diving into the pathfinding system itself.
